## How to run?

If you got `Make` installed simply call it:

```
make
```

This will run the benchmarks and render the figures included in
the [RESULTS.md](./RESULTS.md). Alternatively you can run the benchmarks with cargo...

```
cargo run --release
```

...and then create the SVG files in the figures directory by calling...

```
python3 render-figures.py
```

# FAQ

## Why is `async_object_pool` included in the sources but missing from the results?

`async-object-pool` doesn't really compare to the other pool
implementations. It is *very* fast but neither stores a reference
to the create function nor has any means of recycling values.
